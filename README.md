## Client Requirements
- This project involved creating a day planner with HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and JQuery. It allows users to create a schedule for their day, and save the plan in local storage so that it persists upon refreshing the page.

- This project implements third party APIs such as Bootstrap, JQuery and Moment.js in order to provide streamlined development and a great user experience.

- Time-blocks are dynamically updated with moment.js to display past, present and future events and the current day is always displayed at the top of the page.
